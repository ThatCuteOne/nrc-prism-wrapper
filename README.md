# Usage
1. You need to have logged into the default NRC(Norisk Client) Launcher at least once.
2. Go into Prism(multimc may also work) edit an instance, go to **Settings>Custom Commands**
3. Enter The path to wrapper.py on your pc(on linux you may have to add execute perms)
4. Start your instance
everything else should happen automaticaly

_NOTE: Currently only the fabric versions are supported(1.21+)_


### Todos
- set modloader version
- handle other assets then prod
- verfiy downloads by hash matching with maven repo(http://maven.norisk.gg/repository/norisk-production/gg/norisk/nrc-ui/1.0.78+fabric.1.21.7/nrc-ui-1.0.78+fabric.1.21.7.jar.md5/sha1/sha257/sha512) and modrinth
- force newest setting(force install newest versions from maven repo or modrinth)



#### Ideas
- profile sync and convertion between nrc and prism
