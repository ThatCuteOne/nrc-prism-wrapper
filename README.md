# Features
- Run [Norisk Client](https://norisk.gg/) trough prism launcher or the modrinth app(linux only)
- remove norisk client watermark

## Requirements:
- python 3.x+
- [Required Python packages](https://github.com/ThatCuteOne/nrc-prism-wrapper/blob/master/req.txt)(should be installed automatically)

On some systems(debain based for example) you may need to install the dependencies manually, just look at the [req.txt](https://github.com/ThatCuteOne/nrc-prism-wrapper/blob/master/req.txt) or the [get_dependencies.py](https://github.com/ThatCuteOne/nrc-prism-wrapper/blob/master/src/tasks/get_dependencies.py)


# Usage
1. You need to have logged into the default NRC(Norisk Client) Launcher at least once.
2. Download the nrc-wrapper.pyz from the [releases page](https://github.com/ThatCuteOne/nrc-prism-wrapper/releases)
2. Go into Prism(multimc may also work) edit an instance, go to **Settings>Custom Commands**
3. In "Wrapper command" Enter:
```
python path/to/nrc-wrapper.pyz
```
4. Start your instance
everything else should happen automaticaly


_NOTE: Currently only the fabric versions are supported(1.21+)_

### Todos
- log steaming into modrinth app(if possible)
- set modloader version
- handle assets other then prod
- verfiy downloads by hash matching with maven repo(http://maven.norisk.gg/repository/norisk-production/gg/norisk/nrc-ui/1.0.78+fabric.1.21.7/nrc-ui-1.0.78+fabric.1.21.7.jar.md5/sha1/sha257/sha512) and modrinth
- force newest setting(force install newest versions from maven repo or modrinth)
- full resourcepack override support



#### Ideas
- profile sync and convertion between nrc and prism
